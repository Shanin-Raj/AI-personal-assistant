  - **Quick Summaries:** Uses Gemini AI to provide fast, direct answers for any query.
  - **News Briefing:** Fetches the latest news headlines for a country and delivers a concise, AI-powered summary.

- **Personal Note-Taking**
  - **Add Notes:** Save personal notes with a timestamp using a simple voice command.
  - **View Notes:** Display all your saved notes in the terminal.
